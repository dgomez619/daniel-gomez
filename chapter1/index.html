    <h1>I ONLY DRINK DOUBLESHOT EXPRESSOS</h1>
    <p>I love coffee, but I only drink doubleshot expressos because I really enjoy a cup of pure, oily, and strong coffee. I used to not like coffee, the truth is that I hated it, becuase to me it seemed like so many people were obsessed with coffee and I truly didn't find anything special about the drink, I didn't understand why people were so crazy about coffee, and then I got older, my energy started to decrease, so I tried coffee and I understood why it was such a valuable drink for so many people, becuase it gets you through the day, it actually makes you more of aware of things and it even helps you have a better personality and now I love coffee, if my regular choice is not available, then I just get a black coffee, just recently I started making my own coffee and I like that better.</p>
